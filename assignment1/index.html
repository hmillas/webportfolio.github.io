        I found this reading very interesting. I could not help, but relate to the writer. In the early 2000s my father was studying cyber security and web development. I vividly remember him having a computer in one of the rooms. Booting up my fathers computer would cause that "infamous atonal tune." during the early 2000, I lived in Puerto Rico and it did not feel like the word wide web was something readily available. I spend many hours of my days exploring the web, learning about myths and legends from around the world. I found it interesting talking about the things I learned with my classmates in elementary school. People were often confused about how many different origin stories excised outside of Puerto Rico. I felt like peoples knowledge at the time was limited to what was locally known. I enjoyed verifying everything adults told me on the internet and then presented them with my research. They were not amused.

        In the mid 2000s my usage of the internet focus away from researching myths and legends. I began to play online games. I would spend much of my time outside of school playing games like WODBO (word of dragonball online) on my PC and halo, left 4 dead and borderlands on my Xbox. During this time the internet helped me practice my English. I talked to people from all over the world. This access the the world fueled me to want to travel. I began looking at google maps regularly, learning names of random country and Imagining life there.

        Once the late 2000s happened, I learned that the world wide web could be used to watch videos. I began to visit Youtube frequently and watching anime in random websites. Around 2009/10 I watched all of Dragonball, Yu YU Hakusho, Full metal alchemist, Bleach and Naruto. I would spend my youtube time watching funny fail videos and youtubers like Raywilliamjohnson.

        As time progressed my relationship with the world wide web evolved. I like the writer also noticed a growing change emerging from the web. More and more advertisements began to populate every facet of the web. As it stands now, any video you open chances are an add will appear. Any website you visit will be filled with adds, any app you scroll threw is filled with suggestions, adds, and monetization. Where once I had felt like the internet provided me with an escape, now I feel like I am surfing in a sea of adds. I agree that " Capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love." The friendly nature of the early internet is being replaced  by the corporate greed of a few giant corporations. Without Google telling you what the top suggestion is, there is no limit to what you could find. Without youtube, tiktok and instagram suggesting top post. Everyone post would be equally assessable. I hope that in the near future a new search engine emerges. Once not being shackled by corporate overlords and that caters to the marginalized. Giving people from divers backgrounds a space to create, promote themeselves and learn. Without being bombarded by adds for products the just reverbarate the state of the world. Companies who exploit workers should not be given a space to promote themselves and their CEO should be punished severely. Unfortunately as it stands the internet allows companies to reach a wider range of consumers. These exploitative companies control so much of the internet, it sometimes feel hard to find a place in it for ones self.

        I hope that my responsed did not go too far off course. I think that the world wide web is great. It just needs some better safeguards in place.
