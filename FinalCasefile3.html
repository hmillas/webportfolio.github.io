           Research #3: The DHARMA Initiative and its Hidden Legacy
              </p>

<p>
Subject: Historical Research into the DHARMA Initiative
              </p>
<p>
The DHARMA Initiative, a now-defunct scientific group, conducted extensive research on the island before their mysterious disappearance. Their attempts to study the island’s properties were clearly both ambitious and reckless. ERM has identified several key locations tied to their experiments, which appear to have involved the manipulation of space-time and electromagnetic fields in ways that far surpass current scientific understanding. Some of these experiments may have contributed to the destabilization of the island’s temporal and electromagnetic phenomena.
              </p>

<p>
Objective: ERM intends to locate and secure any remaining DHARMA data, technology, or experiments that could provide us with the tools to master the island’s unique properties. We will ensure that DHARMA’s failed attempts do not hinder our efforts—what they could not control, we will conquer.
