In the darkest corners of the world, where the fabric of reality frays and warps under the strain of anomalies, there exists a force whose name is whispered but never spoken aloud—The ERM. To the public, they are but myths, feared tales, an anonymous agency said to be responsible for the inexplicable and the uncanny. Yet, beneath the cold precision of their mission and the imposing power they wield lies a legacy that few truly understand: the faces, the sacrifices, and the unwavering resolve of those who serve.

Today, we pause to remember the silent architects of the unknown who came before us. The brave souls who, in the name of preserving balance and seizing opportunities hidden within chaos, laid down their lives for a world that may never know the truth. They were not just agents of control and domination; they were people, with dreams and fears, families waiting for their return, and moments of doubt that they overcame with grit and resilience.

    The ERM is not just an organization; it is a brotherhood and sisterhood bound by the shared knowledge of what must be done to protect a world that remains blissfully ignorant of their sacrifices. To many, We are a necessary evil; to some, a source of whispered admiration. To those who have served and fallen, they are immortalized not just in records and archives but in the heart of every agent who continues their work.

To challenge them is to challenge fate, but to remember them is to know that behind every shadow they patrol, behind every decision they make, there is humanity—unseen but never forgotten.
