           Research #2: The Island’s Electromagnetic Field and its Unpredictable Effects
    </p>

<p>
Subject: Electromagnetic Phenomena and Anomaly Manifestations
              </P>   
              
              
<p>
The island's electromagnetic field is unlike any known on Earth. Measurements indicate extreme fluctuations, capable of influencing nearby satellites, aircraft, and even the human mind. Subjects exposed to these anomalies report hallucinations, memory loss, and unexplainable physical transformations. These effects could have far-reaching consequences for global security if left unmonitored.
    </p2>       
              
              
<p>
Objective: We are actively investigating the island’s electromagnetic properties to understand how they might be harnessed or weaponized. Our priority is to establish a permanent presence on the island to monitor and control these phenomena before they fall into the wrong hands.
