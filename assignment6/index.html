        <p>I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question.


Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.'
'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.'
'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.'

I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different.
I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture.
A city where the artist would not fear the censor.
Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality.
Where the great would not be constrained by the small!

>And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.</p>

        <p> Hello Andrew, I reject your answer.
  
         Your perspective is destined for disaster. I predict your city will fall to ruin, your scientist and artist will be driven to insanity. Your city's lack of empathy and moraltiy will cause great harm to the people living in it. Andrew you are just like the religious radical Zachary Hale Comstock.
  
        
        
      
        You hide your greed under the vail of freedom and scientific exploration. You don't care about your people, all you want is control and the freedom to treat individuals as you see fit. 'No!' I reject your answer, you are a vile rich man who wants to control the world. You are just like the people you complain about. 
    
     
        Don't pretend you have sweat on your brow, You've likley never worked a day in your life. </p>
