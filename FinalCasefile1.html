              Research #1: The Temporal Anomalies of the Island
    </p>
<p>
Subject: Island Temporal Distortions
    </p>
<p>
ERM has observed significant and unexplained temporal anomalies centered around the island. These phenomena suggest the island is a focal point for fluctuations in space-time, potentially acting as a conduit between different timelines and dimensions. Preliminary data indicates that time on the island does not flow in accordance with the conventional laws of physics. Survivors' testimonies of time dilation—where hours or days pass in the blink of an eye, or conversely, days stretch on for what feels like years—support our hypothesis.
              </p>
<p>
Objective: Our mission is to gain control over the island’s temporal properties, to understand the mechanisms by which time is altered, and, ultimately, to exploit this for strategic advantage.</p>
